# 3DGS ply2gltf

How to execute:  

`.\ply2gltf.exe some_3dgs.ply --convert --dump`

Generates two files: `some_3dgs.gltf` and `some_3dgs.bin`.

Using the optional `--convert` flag converts from right-handed z-up to right-handed y-up coordinate system by doing a -90 degree rotation around the x-axis.  
Otherwise it is assumed that the original data is already right-handed y-up as defined in glTF.

Using the optional `--dump` flag is writing back the generated glTF binary buffer to the PLY file `some_3dgs_dump.ply`.

## Changelog
